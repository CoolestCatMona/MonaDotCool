## Characterization

Have you ever had **one moment** of a conversation stand out to you? Something that you remember for _years_ afterwards?

Maybe you can't remember the entire context of the conversation, but there's a key piece that _lingers_.

I've been thinking a lot about a compliment a friend gave me a while back. It was in May of 2024, after one of the fighting practices I attend, some friends and I were at a pizza place making idle conversation. While the exact topic eludes me, I remember a compliment that I was given **_vividly_**.

My friend said that I had "classically handsome features".

I wasn't sure why, but I didn't take this as a compliment. I thought maybe they were taking a jab at how I style myself, implying I was out of touch, or maybe they were just making a joke at my expense. I remember getting a tad defensive and it dampened my mood.

There was something about that compliment that _really_ stuck with me. When I think back to other times that I've been called "handsome", I remember having a pretty similar reaction. I would think that the other person was just being nice, or that they were trying to make me feel better about myself, but deep down they were snickering, laughing, taunting.

But obviously friends wouldn't trick me like that; they are genuine in their compliments.

I have a generally poor view of my own body image; I don't really like the way that I look. I am fairly certain I have some flavor of body dysmorphia.

- I think I'm overweight
- I think I'm oddly shaped
- I think I'm way too hairy

This has been a consistency throughout my life. I've had trouble taking compliments in the past, and to an extent I still do.

## Perception

There are other descriptors I'm not the biggest fan of as well. I would have about the same reaction when people would call me "strong" or "tough".

The more thought I put into these descriptors of myself that I didn't agree with, the more I realized they were very masculine-coded.

Quick tangent, **I'm stubborn**. Folks have spoken to me about this before, but I have a habit of justifying staying comfortable.

As much as I dislike masculine descriptors, _feminine_ descriptors don't sit that well with me in a similar way.

For several years, I've identified as nonbinary (He/They). I've struggled with my own expectations and stereotypes associated with that identity. _However_, I understood that I could identify however I want and present however I choose. My identity doesn't _owe anyone_ any specific kind of presentation!

I can _be_ a well-built person and not be strictly male.

As uncomfortable as it would make me, I can _have_ body hair as a masculine person _and_ still be nonbinary.

I can wear my t-shirt and jeans, have stereotypical "dad" fashion, and just tell others I'm nonbinary.

I can swing entirely in one direction and be an _adonis_, but also not be male.

But I tried that, and I would still struggle with self-acceptance issues as far as I presented myself, and I still felt horrible about myself.

I came to realize that I held a negative view about my own masculinity.

A few years back, I thought that maybe I'd lean into some kind of hybrid approach, try being _less_ masculine and adopt some traditionally _non-masculine_ styling. I was going to experiment and change myself, see if making _minor tweaks_ in my appearance would make me feel any better.

- I painted my nails
- I wore more jewelry
- I wore different clothing
- I experimented with _colors_ (or the lack thereof (I got really into black on black))
- I took better care of my skin
- I shaved my body hair more frequently

All around, I just upped my fashion. I felt _better_ about myself for sure, but things still felt... awkward.
Folks around me approved and complimented me, and these felt easier to accept; it felt like some of my work was paying off. Sure, there was still a weird lingering feeling but it was _less_, as if some of the noise was filtered out.

Then, I got a few compliments in particular that stuck with me. A friend who had been talking to me about my fashion said I was a _hot_... **alternative guy**...

Another had mentioned that I'm going through my **goth guy era**.

These all felt very similar to being called "handsome", and anytime I got a compliment like this, I felt a pit form in my stomach; the comments just felt _wrong_.

I didn't understand **why** they felt incorrect, I didn't understand **why** I still disliked the way I looked. I know that I would feel much more comfortable if I was just _less_... masculine.

I'm quite **_stubborn_**.

## Confusion

I was so confused; looking at myself filled me with a mix of disgust and anger. I didn't understand why I couldn't see myself the way that others saw me...

Another quick tangent: Something positive I'll say about myself, which you may or may not have heard me say, is that **I'm something of an athlete**.

Maybe I could fix these problems I saw in myself naturally.

In an effort to make myself _leaner_, I started exercising more frequently, specifically focusing on cardio/stamina and fat loss. Pair that with a healthier diet, and it's a good recipe for change. After all, nothing will change unless I take the steps to make the change myself.

After a few months, it's noticeable; others are commenting on my weight, the scale reads lower and lower, I go down a shirt size or two.

I look at pictures of myself and am noticeably thinner.

**However**, nothing really changed about how I feel (emotionally). I would still look at myself at the end of the day and feel extremely... gross...

Still fat, still oddly shaped, still disgusting.

I am self-aware enough to understand that these are simply untrue, negative thoughts, but they seem to be ever-present unless I distract myself with something or have some kind of clarity.

I think I have the most mental clarity in the mornings, usually right after I wake up; I remember waking up one morning, and looking in the mirror, I could see each bone on my ribcage, and there was only a small amount of fat on my stomach. I wasn't underweight, but I certainly _was not_ overweight.

**Maybe** I had some loose skin around my abdomen from being heftier when I was younger, and **maybe** there was a small amount of fat still present, but I was _not_ overweight.

I stood there, looking in the mirror, wondering, debating with myself, perplexed.

**Why** did I think about myself the way I did? It was all so confusing and I _hated_ being confused.

## Innocence

I agreed to watch a friend's dog for a few weeks in the late spring of 2025.

Prior to watching their dog, we had scheduled a playdate, a really simple trip to the park with both of our pets.

I don't think I'll forget that trip to the dog park.

Myself, my friend, his partner, their child, and each of our dogs.

Their child was only a few years old. They were playing around with the few words and sounds they knew; almost every sentence that came out of their mouth was brand new, never spoken before.

While the dogs were playing, I was speaking with my friend about... something... I can't exactly remember what, but what I do remember is the child coming up to us, and looking at me.

The father said, "Look, it's _Mona_! Can you say Mona?". The child giggled and looked away, either embarrassed, or too shy to speak.

"Say, **Uncle** Mona! It's **Uncle** Mona!" The father spoke playfully to the child, smiling. I was **stunlocked**.

Suddenly, in an instant, my heart was beating faster, my mind started racing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_That's not right._

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Why is that not right?_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Do I look weird?_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Is it an age thing?_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Why does that feel wrong?_

I blinked; it had been a few seconds, which is **several seconds** longer than I think anyone would normally think about being called "Uncle". I don't even think the child responded, just as I had come out of my stupor, the words were spoken aloud again.

"**Uncle Mona!**" he said, encouraging the child.

I'd never been pulled back down so fast, so quickly.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_That's not right._

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_That's **not** right._

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Why am I putting so much thought into this?_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_What's wrong with me?_

After another thought spiral that I would argue does _not_ normally happen with such small comments, I managed to shake it off, **but it lingered**.

Honestly, that's where my memory of that playdate stops. I may have been less talkative for the remainder, but I know I just wanted to _leave_.

## Clarity

I started doing _research_. I wanted to _understand_. I wanted to not be _confused_.

After several hours, I made an _appointment_.

I wasn't going to be **stubborn** anymore; I was going to find clarity, and I was going to **trust my own judgement**.

Leading up to the appointment, and for several weeks following, I would talk to a subset of my friends about my feelings, my thoughts, and my experiences. I wanted to gather as much information as possible; I wanted to learn from others.

That is to say, on **June 6th of 2025**, I started undergoing hormone replacement therapy in an effort to feel more comfortable in my own body.

Anyways, I wanted to write about and share _only a few_ of the thoughts and feelings I had leading up to the decision to start taking hormones. Since then, I've had a lot of time to talk to folks, and I've realized a lot of other _indicators_ that were present.

I'm writing this only four months into my journey, and I feel no regrets.

Nothing has really changed _physically_ about me, but I feel like I can finally look at myself in the mirror without feeling weird. I've been feeling _better_, I've been feeling _lucid_, overall, I've just been feeling more comfortable in my own skin.

I want to take the time to reflect on all the other ways that I've been feeling awesome and great in a separate dedicated post, if I can.

Thank you for taking the time to read this far. I'm thankful for the support, and I'm extremely hopeful for what my future holds.
