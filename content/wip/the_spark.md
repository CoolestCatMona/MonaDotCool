## Where did the spark go?

I've been scrolling through older posts on social media recently, feeling nostalgiac for personal projects that I used to work on or share.

I wonder why I stopped working on them.

I defintiely started them because they were genuinely interesting to me. C# projects, Udon, music production, creating avatars in blender, refining textures in substance and photoshop, even creating this website; creating something scratches a very unique itch in my mind that floods me with the happy chemical that something like videogames simply cannot.

I am a product of the environment around me. A lot of my friends work on creative projects, and have plenty to show for it, each and every one of them inspires me to create.

Why did I stop?

I don't think I was getting enough feedback, or a chance to showcase what I've worked on in any meaningful capacity.

It's incredibly difficult to be socially anxious and ask for an opportunity to show off what I create or something that interests me around people that I deeply respect and admire.

Priorities in life shift, I don't have the time to spend around people who inspire me as much as I used to. I become a consumer instead of a collaborator.

I lack the time to dedicate myself to these crafts, to truly refine my skills and produce work that I'm proud of. As soon as I get into the groove of something, life seems to throw a wrench and shift my focus somewhere else. Housing, health, work, love, all seem to take precendence at one point or another.

I hold myself to such incredibly high standards, standards that I'll probably never be able to meet, and it holds me back from sharing my work and connecting with others who might appreciate it.

It's definitely a mix of all of the above, I know that I want to do these things, and realistically, I am my biggest adversary to see things through.

I'd like to change that, and I think the first step is to start small. I need to find ways to reintroduce creativity into my life without the pressure of high expectations. Whether it's dedicating a few minutes each day to a personal project, or simply sharing my thoughts and ideas more openly, I want to create an environment where I can thrive as a creator again.

I need to stop being negative about my abilities and start embracing the process of creation, no matter how small the steps may be.
